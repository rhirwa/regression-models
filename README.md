# Regression Models
Machine learning is exciting! This repository features linear regression, multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, decision tree regression, and support vector regression. There are also classification models like logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, kernel SVM, naive bayes, decision tree classification, and random forest classification. The programs featured make predictions based off of learning and training from prior similar datasets, and this helps the models forecast values for new data they're fed.
